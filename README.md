# port-scanner
I'm working on a Python-based port scanner that detects open ports on a specified IP address. It uses multithreading with ThreadPoolExecutor for faster scans and the socket library to attempt connections on each port. The tool includes visual enhancements using the pystyle library for colored output, making the scan results easy to read.
